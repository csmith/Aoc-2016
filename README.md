# Advent of Code 2016

This repository contains my solution to 2016's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2016) puzzles. The solutions
are all written in Python 3; one or two may require the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) package, but the rest should
work out-of-the-box.

I tend to focus on short, functional solutions where possible, so they may be a bit hard to read. Some solutions are
commented to some degree to help with that.
